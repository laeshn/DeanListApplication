The Dean’s List Application System is designed to modernize and streamline the recognition of outstanding students. It manages submissions seamlessly, automatically ranks candidates based on their General Weighted Average (GWA), and ensures deadlines are met without students missing their chance to be acknowledged. Administrators benefit from an intuitive dashboard that not only allows them to oversee submissions, verify eligibility, and publish results efficiently, but also provides access to students’ past rankings and performance history. This enables the generation of detailed reports for academic tracking and institutional records. 

This system was developed on the year 2025-2026 mainly for CCS students who are studying at LSPU - SC. 
This was made for our subject ITST 302 - Client Server Technologies
